/**
 * The Decorator pattern allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure.
 * This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern acts as a wrapper to the existing class.
 * That is there will be additional features added to the original object.
 * The component, which adds these additional features is called the Decorator.
 * An example would be creating different flavours of Coffee according to customer choices.
 * Problems solved
 * ----------------
 * Responsibilities should be added to (and removed from) an object dynamically at run-time.
 * A flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality should be provided.
 * Steps
 * -----
 * 1.
